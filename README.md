We created our take on the popular windows game "Minesweeper", This a player solving strategy game 
where the objecvtive is to locate the bombs on the grid based map without detonating a bomb. You are to 
locate the bombs to safely nagivate the map. Our map size can either be 9x9 all the way up to 36x36 
also allowing for weird dimension rectangels such as 9x36. The player can determine how many bombs are placed 
on the map deciding how difficult they want it to be. The game is timed adding a sense of urgency to try
solve the puzzle. 

Good Luck! and Have Fun!
